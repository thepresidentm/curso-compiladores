/**
 * NfaSimulator
 * ------------
 * This class provides functionality to simulate a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA)
 * on a given input string. It determines whether the input string is accepted by the NFA by processing
 * each character and tracking the set of possible states, including those reachable via epsilon (ε) transitions.
 *
 * Simulation steps:
 * - Initialize the set of current states with the ε-closure of the NFA's start state.
 * - For each character in the input, compute the next set of states by following transitions labeled with that character,
 *   and include all states reachable via ε-transitions from those states.
 * - After processing the input, check if any of the current states is a final (accepting) state.
 *
 * The class also provides a helper method to compute the ε-closure of a given state, which is the set of all states
 * reachable from the given state using only ε-transitions.
